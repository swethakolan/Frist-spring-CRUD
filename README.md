# First Spring Boot Project

## 📌 Overview

This is my first Spring Boot project where I learned the basics of building a backend application using Spring Boot.

The project focuses on understanding **layered architecture** and how different layers interact with each other in a Spring Boot application.

---

## ✨ Features

* Create a user
* Add a user
* Simple user management flow

---

## 🧱 Architecture Used

This project follows a **layered architecture**:

* **Controller Layer** – Handles HTTP requests and responses
* **Service Layer** – Contains business logic
* **Repository Layer** – Simulates data access logic
* **Database Layer** – Not connected to a real database; uses a simulated array for learning purposes

---

## 🗄️ Data Handling

* No real database is connected
* User data is stored in a **simulated array**
* This approach was used to clearly understand how data flows across layers

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Java
* Spring Boot
* Maven
* Postman (for API testing)

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding Spring Boot project structure
* Clear knowledge of Controller, Service, Repository, and DB layers
* How data flows in a backend application
* Writing clean and modular code

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Connect to a real database (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
* Implement CRUD operations
* Add validation and exception handling

---

## 📬 Note

This project is purely for **learning and practice purposes**.
